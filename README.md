## Hey there 👋

I'm Milo, a computer science student based in Lyon, France.

I'm currently at 42 Lyon school, learning strong foundations for my future career.
At the moment, I'm doing the last project of 42 : Transcendance.

I love mobile development, I made two mobile apps so far.

My current challenge is learning typescript over javascript.
